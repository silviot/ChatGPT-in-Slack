## How It Works

You can interact with ChatGPT like you do in the website. In the same thread, the bot remember what you already said.

Consider this realistic scenario: ask the bot to generate a business email for communication with your manager.

With ChatGPT, you don't need to ask a perfectly formulated question at first. Adjusting the details after receiving the bot's initial response is a great approach.
